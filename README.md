# UPlanet: A Decentralized Information Ecosystem

**OSM2IPFS** : the Exploration Interface >>> [OSM2IPFS : Base REPO](https://git.p2p.legal/qo-op/OSM2IPFS) <<<

## Introduction

UPlanet is a non-commercial, decentralized, and resilient free information system. It brings data to life, unveiling the intricacy of the social and environmental fabric through a unique visualization. Every glowing point, every inscription, represents a signature etched into the digital framework of this ever-evolving world.

## The UPlanet Solution

UPlanet's solution is a grid-based system that represents geolocation data. The system is divided into UMAP, SECTOR, REGION, ZONE, and WORLD, each requiring a different number of signatures. This system ensures data accuracy and empowers users by giving them control over their data.

## Data Aggregation and Security

UPlanet collects and aggregates data from various sources. It integrates with Astroport.ONE for enhanced data security. This system is designed to resist failures, data loss, attacks, and fraud.

## Collaborative Administration and Modularity

UPlanet's approach to administration is collaborative. The Stations are physically located at the place of their "admin", promoting self-hosting. This is where a second web of trust is built, that of the Dragons, who host the data in their homes. The most starred join the "Bootstrap", and all the "dragons" agree to share their SSH connection, allowing users to be assisted in self-hosting.

## UPlanet's Mission

UPlanet is described as a digital space where people can express themselves freely. It functions as a distributed ledger to share common information and is presented as a free planet. UPlanet emphasizes the right to free speech and the right to copy, with respect for authors. It positions itself as the only digital space guaranteeing these rights.

## UPlanet's Blockchain Integration

UPlanet is described as a "step-by-step" blockchain using pooled resources of "â™¥BOXes" with IPFS and IPNS. It highlights the transparency and control provided by free and clear source code and scalable algorithms.

## UPlanet's Development Stage

The project is in the proof of concept stage. Documentation and development are ongoing. UPlanet aims to create a distributed information system with open-source components. IPFS is utilized for storage and sharing, creating a tamper-proof and uncensored system.

## Conclusion

UPlanet is a transformative approach to information management. It is a decentralized, resilient, and non-commercial free information system that empowers users and ensures data accuracy. With its integration with Astroport.ONE, it offers enhanced data security and a unique approach to data visualization.

## Crypto Commons United Planet -

OSM2IPFS gives a "partition table" to IPFS and a 5 layer information grid over our planet
Blockchains are like spagetti in cyberspace.

UPlanet is linking crypto keys to locations and people on the planet
Now, identified and geolocalized data can be co-signed and affined

NB: Stations from "BooStrap" are runs by Dragons, who followed a specific keygen procedure.
Thus publish Docker Applications either on IP or IPFS p2p
